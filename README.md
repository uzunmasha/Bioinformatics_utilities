# Bioinformatics_utilities
This repository contains homework scripts developed in the Python course at the [Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/education/program) during the 2023-2024 academic year. Code with examples in the showcases.py notebook is marked with *.

### bioseq.py
This script provides various functionalities for working with biological data.
* `RNASequence/DNASequence/AminoAcidSequence` classes *

Assists in working with DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequencing data. 
* `filter_fastq` function

Filters FASTQ files based on GC content, sequence length, and quality threshold.
* `run_genscan` function *

Uses the [Genscan](http://hollywood.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) prediction tool for DNA sequences, and extracts predicted peptide sequences, intron, and exon information.
* `telegram_logger` decorator

Sends messages and log files of run scripts to a Telegram chat for notification purposes. Implementation of this function was based on [Telegram bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

### bio_files_processor.py
* `convert_multiline_fasta_to_oneline` function

Converts any number of DNA/RNA/protein sequences in FASTA file from multi-line FASTA files into one-line FASTA format.
* `OpenFasta` context manager *

Opens FASTA files, like the `open` built-in function. Returns separate FASTA records including ID, description, and sequence.

### custom_random_forest.py
* `RandomForestClassifierCustom` class *

Allows to apply parallelization for custom random forest class for faster usage

### test_modules.py
Contains tests to verify the functionality of the code in `bioseq.py` and `bio_files_processor.py`

### showcases.py
Demonstrates examples of using functions and classes from other files in the repository.

### Gratitudes
As a student of this course, I want to express my gratitude to the entire team behind this course. 

Studying Python with your engaging lectures, helpful consultations, and challenging but interesting homework assignments has truly been an incredible experience.

I've had an amazing time, and I can't thank you enough for it!
